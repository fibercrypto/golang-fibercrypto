# Contributing to FiberCrypto projects
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Submitting a [bug report](https://github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug_report.md)
- Discussing the current state of the code on [Blockchain Cuba channel](https://t.me/BlockchainCuba)
- Submitting a [new Github pull request](https://github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet/pull/new) with a fix
- Proposing new [features requests](https://github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet/issues/new?labels=feature&template=feature_request.md)
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
   * Branch name should follow the pattern `<USER>_t<ISSUE>_<DESC>` e.g. `olemis_t256_readme_badges` for @olemis to submit a patch to fix issue #256 by adding project badges in `README.md` file.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. If contributions add a relevant feature, describe changes in CHANGELOG.md
5. Check Travis build results.
6. Ensure the test suite passes on Travis.
7. Make sure your code lints on Travis.
8. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPLv3 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPLv3 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/fibercrypto/FiberCryptoWallet/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report that we think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom we greatly respect.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [This stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what reporter was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Code style shall respect golang standards and is checked by a number of linters after running `make lint` from the command line.
